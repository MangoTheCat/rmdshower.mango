# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("MangoTheCat/rmdshower.mango")
```

## Usage

To use a theme package in an Rmd file, you can simply refer to its name in the `theme` parameter of the YAML header, and `rmdshower` will look up the package and insert the appropriate CSS and other files in the output. As an example, to use the `rmdshower.mango` theme:

```
---
title: "Shower Presentations with R Markdown"

ratio: 16x10

    katex: true
    theme: mango

```
